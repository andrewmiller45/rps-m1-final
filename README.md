## Introduction
  - The purpose of this project was to demonstrate all of the languages that we have learned during the course of Mod1.  We built out a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors using HTML, CSS, and JS that users can play on their browsers.

## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - HTML
  - CSS

## Illustrations
  
## Features
- Choose your game mode between vanilla or spicy mode.
- See the computer's choice in-game.
- Keeps track of the total wins.
- You have the ability to change the game mode in the middle of your session.

## Deployed Page
Visit my published RPS game! [here](https://andrewmiller45.github.io/rps-m1-final/)

## Possible Future Extensions
  - It would be cool to build some AI or game theory type logic that does not randomize the computer's choice and instead looks to make exploits based on user inputs.

## Set Up
1. Fork this repo
2. Clone the repo to your local machine
3. View the project in the browser by running open index.html in your terminal.
